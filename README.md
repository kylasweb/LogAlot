# LogAlot: AI-Powered Log Analysis Platform

LogAlot is a sophisticated, AI-driven platform designed to automate the analysis of application error logs. It leverages a team of specialized AI agents working in configurable workflows to diagnose issues, suggest solutions, and integrate with your existing DevOps toolchain.

## Key Features

- **Agentic AI Workflows**: Instead of a single AI, LogAlot uses a customizable team of agents. Each agent has a specific role (e.g., Summarizer, Traceback Analyzer, Solution Generator), and their outputs are chained together to provide a deep, multi-step analysis.
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: An intuitive drag-and-drop interface to create, modify, and reorder agentic workflows. You can build custom analysis pipelines tailored to specific needs.
- **Advanced Agent Management**:
  - **Fine-Tuning**: Train agents on your own log data to improve their accuracy and domain-specific knowledge.
  - **A/B Testing**: Experiment with different prompts, models, or configurations to find the most effective setup for each agent.
  - **Hyper-parameter Tuning**: Granular control over AI model parameters like `temperature` and `top-p` to adjust the creativity and precision of agent responses.
- **Dynamic Analysis Engine**: The main dashboard allows you to paste or upload logs and get a comprehensive report generated by your active agent workflow.
- **Integrated Knowledge Base**: Built-in documentation covering guides, how-to's, system logic, and configurations.
- **Connectors**: Seamlessly send analysis reports to third-party services like Jira, Microsoft Teams, and GitHub.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js, React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, and Genkit for robust and scalable performance.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized logically to separate concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend.

### Core Concepts

- **Agents (`src/ai/flows`)**: Each file in this directory defines a single AI agent using Genkit's `defineFlow` and `definePrompt`. They are self-contained and specialized for one task.
- **Workflows (`src/app/(protected)/agentic`)**: The UI on this page allows users to construct a `Workflow` object, which is an ordered array of `Agent` objects.
- **Analysis (`src/app/actions.ts`)**: The `analyzeLogsAction` server action receives the raw logs and the `Workflow` object. It dynamically iterates through the agents in the workflow, calling the corresponding Genkit flow for each and passing the context from one to the next.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your AI provider API keys.
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Open the Application**:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:9002` in your browser to start using the application.

## How to Use

1.  **Configure Agents**: Go to the **Agentic** page to review the available AI agents. You can create new ones or edit existing ones, defining their system instructions and model.
2.  **Build a Workflow**: Use the **Agent Workflow Builder** on the Agentic page to drag agents into a sequence. You can start from scratch with a "Custom Workflow" or use a pre-built template.
3.  **Analyze Logs**: Navigate to the **Dashboard**, paste your error logs, and click "Analyze Logs". The active workflow from the Agentic page will be used to generate the report.
4.  **Explore Advanced Features**: Use the Fine-Tuning, A/B Testing, and Hyper-parameters pages to optimize your agents for specific tasks.
